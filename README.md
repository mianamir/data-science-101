# Data Science 101

There are four areas that are valuable to learn for data science (there might be more, but this is how I like to think about it):

1. Data analysis and visualization - “data storytelling”. If you are interested in the statistics side of data science as a more advanced option, you can dive into traditional “data modeling” techniques and go from there.
2. Machine learning. There are two primary approaches to statistical modeling: a) data modeling, such as linear regression, and b) algorithmic modeling, such as decision trees and neural networks. Depending on your interest, you can dive deeper into neural networks/deep learning if you want.
3. Deployment/processing APIs and infrastructure (e.g., efficient database structures for data processing and technologies like Spark and Redis). Learning this collection of concepts is particularly useful for handling big data.
4. Ethics of data science and intersection of data science with other fields.
5. Something you’ll have to do is research different topics within data science and see what you like. What business field do you like : marketing, finance, hr, etc. What do you like: manufacturing, medical, e-commerce, etc. These two questions are something you need to think about and look into.
6. Focus on some subfield of the ML world: Computer Vision, NLP, Medical applications, Reinforcement Learning
